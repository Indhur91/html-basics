        <p>The Library offers early registration to give students a head-start at signing up before school is out. Participants can create a free online account to track reading time, learning and leisure activities during the duration of the program. Summer Break encourages participants of all ages – children, teens and adults – to read 20 minutes per day and engage in additional learning activities such as writing, creating, playing, exploring and giving. As participants track their activities online, they collect virtual badges and incentives. 

            Summer Break participants complete the program by earning 1200 points. 1 minute of reading equals 1 point. At least 600 points must be earned by reading (equivalent of 10 hours). Learning activities are worth 20 points each. Sign up for Summer Break and get a coupon for a free Jr. Frosty from Wendy's.
